Emerging Technology Project 

Overview

This is the repository for the emerging technologies modules project worth 50%. The project brief is displayed below and outlines what needs to be done in this project.

The Brief

In this project you must create a web service that uses machine learning to make predictions based on the data set powerproduction. The goal is to produce a model that accurately predicts wind turbine power output from wind speed values, as in the data set.You must then develop a web service that will respond with predicted power values based on speed values sent as HTTP requests.

Jupyter notebook that trains a model using the data set. In the notebook you should explain your model and give an analysis of its accuracy.

Python script that runs a web service based on the model, as above.

Dockerfile to build and run the web service in a container.

Standard items in a git repository such as a README.

What to Install and how to run the web app

What needs to be installed for this project : Python, Flask, Tensorflow and Jupyter Notebook.

The way to run this project is :

Clone this Repository on your command line (cmd).

When cloned, go into the folder where the repository is on your file system and open up the command prompt.

Use the command "set FLASK_APP=webapp.py".

Then Run the command "python -m flask run".

After these commands are run a URL should show up inside the command window. Pasting this URL into your browser will then allow you to locally access the web application via the browser.
